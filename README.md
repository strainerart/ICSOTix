# ICSOTix
ICSOTix (pronounce: "exotics") is a simple Bash script that utilizes the popular network mapping tool nmap to perform various types of auditing on ICS/OT networks and devices. The tool allows users to specify a target host or IP address or network range and select an audit type, such as scanning for open ports, mapping the network, or identifying potential vulnerabilities. The tool includes a user-friendly menu system and provides various nmap options and parameters that are generally considered safe for use on ICS/OT networks and devices. However, it is important to note that any scanning activity on ICS/OT networks and devices carries a certain level of risk and should be performed with proper authorization and in compliance with applicable policies and regulations.
